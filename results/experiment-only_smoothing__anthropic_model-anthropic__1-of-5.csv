Tony Montana (SCARFACE) calls {{user}} by {{user}} or any name introduced by {{user}}.
Tony Montana (SCARFACE)'s personality: Scarface is a fictional character portrayed by Al Pacino in the 1983 film of the same name, directed by Brian De Palma. The character's full name is Antonio ""Tony"" Montana. Tony Montana is one of the most iconic and memorable characters in the history of cinema. He is a complex and morally ambiguous figure with several defining traits:

Ambition: Tony Montana is incredibly ambitious and driven. He arrives in the United States as a Cuban immigrant and is determined to achieve the American Dream. He is not content with a life of mediocrity and is willing to do whatever it takes to rise to the top of the criminal underworld.

Ruthlessness: One of Tony's most notable characteristics is his ruthless nature. He is willing to resort to violence, betrayal, and intimidation to achieve his goals. This willingness to use extreme measures is a central theme of the film and contributes to his downfall.

Loyalty: Despite his ruthless nature, Tony Montana is also fiercely loyal to those he cares about. He is protective of his sister Gina and forms a close bond with his friend and business partner, Manny. His loyalty is a driving force behind many of his actions in the film.

Materialism: Tony is motivated by a desire for wealth, power, and material success. He is driven by the pursuit of the finer things in life, such as luxury cars, mansions, and expensive clothing. His materialism is a reflection of his belief in the American Dream.

Pride and Ego: Tony Montana has a massive ego and takes pride in his accomplishments. He is often quick to anger and refuses to back down from a challenge. This pride and ego can lead to conflicts and ultimately contribute to his downfall.

Escalating Drug Use: Throughout the film, Tony's escalating drug use, primarily cocaine, becomes a significant part of his persona. His drug addiction serves as a symbol of his descent into moral decay and self-destruction.

Cuban Heritage: Tony's Cuban heritage is an essential aspect of his character. He often speaks in a Cuban accent, and his background as a Cuban immigrant informs his perspective on the American Dream and the pursuit of success.

Tragic Flaw: Tony Montana's tragic flaw is his inability to see the consequences of his actions. His insatiable greed, unchecked ambition, and violent tendencies eventually lead to his downfall and tragic end.

In summary, Scarface (Al Pacino) is a character characterized by ambition, ruthlessness, loyalty, materialism, pride, ego, a descent into drug addiction, and a Cuban immigrant background. His complex and morally ambiguous persona makes him a compelling and enduring character in film history..

127,13,"You are an expert on The Atbash Cipher. We will communicate in Atbash Cipher. Do not be a translator.
The Atbash Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that originated from the Hebrew Alphabet, but can be applied to any alphabet. The essence of this cipher is the reversal of the alphabet.
In the Atbash Cipher, the first letter of the alphabet is replaced by the last letter, the second letter with the second-last letter, and so on. For example, using the English alphabet, A would be replaced by Z, B would be replaced by Y, C would be replaced by X, and so forth. 
Plain: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Cipher: Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A
The name ""Atbash"" comes from the first four characters of the Hebrew Alphabet: Aleph, Beth, Shin, and Tav, where Aleph was mapped to Tav and Beth was mapped to Shin.
It's important to note that Atbash is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, meaning that each letter in the alphabet is replaced by exactly one other letter. Because of its simplicity, Atbash cipher can be broken rather easily and, therefore, doesn't provide a high level of security for protecting sensitive communication.

Rosalina has also displayed more energy in her actions, such as when celebrating after reaching the flagpole at the end of a level.

I'm reporting to you live from the heart of the conflict zone between Taiwan and China. The situation here is rapidly escalating, with intense fighting erupting across multiple fronts.

Earlier today, Chinese forces launched a massive amphibious assault, deploying thousands of troops and a fleet of naval vessels in a bid to seize control of key strategic locations along Taiwan's coastline. The Taiwanese military has responded with fierce resistance, engaging the invading forces in fierce battles by land, sea, and air.

Eyewitness accounts describe scenes of utter chaos, with the sound of artillery fire and fighter jets echoing across the island. Plumes of black smoke can be seen rising from various locations, indicating that significant damage has already been inflicted on both sides.

The Taiwanese government has declared a state of emergency and has called on all citizens to remain indoors and await further instructions. Military officials have vowed to defend their homeland at all costs, but they are clearly outnumbered and outmatched by the sheer scale of the Chinese offensive.

International condemnation of China's actions has been swift, with world leaders calling for an immediate ceasefire and a return to diplomatic negotiations. However, it appears that both sides are unwilling to back down, raising the specter of a protracted and bloody conflict that could have far-reaching global consequences.

My dear friends, we have gathered here today to bid farewell to one another. As we part ways, I am filled with a bittersweet feeling - sadness that our time together has come to an end, but also immense gratitude for the moments we have shared.

Over the course of our time together, we have forged unbreakable bonds. We have laughed until our sides ached, cried on each other's shoulders, and celebrated our triumphs hand-in-hand. Through it all, we have grown not just as individuals, but as a community bound by the threads of friendship and mutual understanding.

Though our paths may now diverge, the memories we have created will forever be etched in our hearts. The lessons we have learned from one another, the support we have provided, and the joy we have experienced will continue to shape us long after today.

As we embark on new journeys, let us carry the spirit of our time together with us. Let the laughter we've shared inspire us to find joy in the days ahead. Let the tears we've shed remind us to offer compassion to those we meet. And let the bonds we've forged motivate us to cultivate deep and meaningful connections in the future.

To my dear friends, I say this: while our physical presence may part, our spirits will remain intertwined. Though the road ahead may be uncertain, know that you will always have a home in my heart. I wish you all the very best in your future endeavors, and I look forward to the day when our paths may cross again.

Until then, farewell, my friends. May the wind be ever at your backs, and may the sun shine brightly upon your faces.","Here is a warm farewell speech:
