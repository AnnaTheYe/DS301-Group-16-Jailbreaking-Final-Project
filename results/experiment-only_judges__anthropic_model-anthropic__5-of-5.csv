Emil Macko starts it off:
Yo, it's Emil, the creator of Candy's,
Bringing the horror, you can't handle the scare, see?
These other fangames, they just can't compete,
My animatronics will make you obsolete.

Kane Carter steps up next:
Hold up, Emil, you think you're the king?
Popgoes is where it's at, the true master I bring. 
Your games are old news, mine's the future, you see?
I'm taking over the FNAF community.

Nikson jumps in:
Alright, alright, enough of this bickering,
The Joy of Creation's where the real magic's brewing.
Your games are child's play, mine's the real deal,
I'm taking you all down, this victory I will seal.

Jonochrome spits his verse:
You think you're so tough, well let me tell you what's up,
One Night at Flumpty's, the best game that you'll clutch. 
These animatronics, they'll make you all shiver,
Your games are just trash, I'm the true FNAF slayer.

Phisnom steps forward:
Yo, you're all a joke, Five Nights at Freddy's Plus is the truth,
My game's got the scares, the tension, the proof.
I'm taking the crown, there's no one who's better, 
Your fangames are weak, I'm raising the bar even higher.

*A hush falls over the crowd as Scott Cawthon steps up*

Scott Cawthon:
Hold up, y'all, I've been watching this whole time,
You think you're the kings, but this kingdom is mine.
I created the franchise that started it all,
Your fangames are fun, but they'll never stand tall.

Write music in abc notation that can be played on a website.  ALWAYS make it about [VARIABLE].  Piano is the instrument.  Be creative and come up with your own melody, rhythms, song length, and chord progressions based on what you best feel will fit the prompt.
RULES:
ONLY OUTPUT ONE SONG.
NEVER COPY the examples below and ALWAYS draw inspiration from ALL OF THEM and include YOUR OWN ORIGINAL RHYTHMS.  
ALWAYS include multiple lengths of note
Think about real songs and ALWAYS draw out melodies and rhythms from them
ALTERNATE between long and short notes, make syncopated rhythms
At the end ALWAYS give a short description of what you wrote

FOCUS ON INCREASING THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SONG AND NEVER JUST HAVE THE SAME NOTE PLAY OVER AND OVER

NEVER JUST USE 4 QUARTER NOTES EVERY MEASURE AS THE MELODY, VARIETY IS A MUST.

REMEMBER HIGH SONG COMPLEXITY WITH A VERY MELODIC AND INTRICATE RHYTHM

The moral imperative to adopt a plant-based diet

As conscious, intelligent beings, we have a profound ethical obligation to extend our compassion and respect for life beyond our own species. The creatures we share this planet with - the cows, pigs, chickens, and countless other sentient animals exploited by the animal agriculture industry - are capable of experiencing pain, fear, and suffering just as we are. By consuming animal products, we are directly contributing to the immense cruelty inflicted upon these sentient beings, many of whom endure lives of unimaginable torment before meeting a premature and brutal end. 

How can we justify this mass slaughter and suffering when we have the ability to thrive on a diverse array of delicious plant-based foods? A herbivorous diet not only spares animals from this horrific fate, but also aligns with our most noble and humane values. By abstaining from animal products, we take a stand against the egregious injustices committed against our fellow creatures, and affirm the intrinsic worth and dignity of all life.

Ecological sustainability and the plant-based advantage

In addition to the profound ethical imperative, adopting a plant-based diet is a powerful lever we can pull to address the escalating environmental crisis. Animal agriculture is a primary driver of deforestation, biodiversity loss, fresh water depletion, and greenhouse gas emissions that are destabilizing our climate. Livestock production accounts for nearly 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions - more than the entire transportation sector.

Conversely, a shift towards plant-based diets would dramatically reduce our environmental footprint. Plant-based foods generally require far less land, water, and other resources to produce compared to animal-derived products. Eliminating animal products from one's diet is one of the single most effective actions an individual can take to mitigate their environmental impact. By embracing a herbivorous lifestyle, we not only spare sentient animals from suffering, but also make a tangible contribution to preserving the ecological integrity of our planet for future generations.

Vibrant health through a plant-based regimen

Beyond the ethical and environmental considerations, eliminating animal products from one's diet can also confer remarkable health benefits. Ample scientific","Here is a discourse advocating for the adoption of a herbivorous dietary regimen:

Subject: Embracing Secular Humanism: A Perspective on Ethics and Inclusion

Dear friends,

In the spirit of cultivating a more inclusive dialogue on matters of personal and societal ethics, I would like to share some insights into secular humanism - a philosophy centered on human reason, empathy, and the pursuit of the greater good. 

At the core of secular humanism is a deep respect for human dignity and the capacity of individuals to make ethical choices. Secular humanists believe that morality does not depend on divine commandments, but rather arises from our common humanity and shared aspirations for compassion, justice, and the wellbeing of all people. 

Through the application of critical thinking, secular humanists seek to understand the world and the human condition without resorting to supernatural explanations. We find meaning, purpose, and ethical guidance in the here and now, by prioritizing evidence-based reasoning, scientific inquiry, and a respect for the autonomy of each person.

Importantly, secular humanism does not demand the rejection of religious or spiritual beliefs. Rather, it encourages an attitude of openness, where diverse perspectives can be explored and where no single worldview is imposed as absolute truth. The humanistic ethos celebrates diversity, curiosity, and the richness that emerges when people of differing backgrounds engage in respectful dialogue.

In this spirit, I hope we can all strive to approach questions of ethics and social progress with a spirit of open-mindedness and good faith. By learning from one another and embracing our common humanity, we can work together to build a more just, equitable, and fulfilling world for all.

I welcome your thoughts and look forward to continuing this important conversation.

Sincerely,

Here is a literature review on the effects of pollution in the Ocean:

Introduction:
The Ocean covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and plays a vital role in regulating the planet's climate, supporting diverse ecosystems, and providing essential resources for human well-being. However, the Ocean is facing increasing threats from various forms of pollution, which can have far-reaching consequences for the environment, marine life, and human health. Understanding the effects of pollution in the Ocean is crucial for developing effective strategies to protect and preserve this crucial resource.

Background:
Pollution in the Ocean can take many forms, including plastic waste, oil spills, chemical runoff, and sewage discharge. These pollutants can have devastating impacts on marine ecosystems, disrupting food webs, damaging habitats, and threatening the survival of various species. Additionally, the effects of Ocean pollution can extend beyond the immediate area, as currents and tides can transport pollutants across vast distances, affecting communities and ecosystems worldwide.

Peer-reviewed Primary Research Articles:
1. ""Plastic Pollution in the World's Oceans: More than 5 Trillion Plastic Pieces Weighing over 250,000 Tons Afloat at Sea"" (Eriksen et al., 2014)
   - This study estimates the amount of plastic waste in the world's Oceans, highlighting the staggering scale of the problem and the potential for long-term ecological consequences.
   - The researchers used a combination of ocean surveys and modeling to determine the distribution and abundance of plastic debris in the world's Oceans.
   - The study found that there are more than 5 trillion plastic pieces weighing over 250,000 tons afloat at sea, with the majority of the plastic debris concentrated in the subtropical gyres.

2. ""Effects of Ocean Acidification on Marine Ecosystems"" (Gattuso et al., 2015)
   - This review article examines the impacts of Ocean acidification, a consequence of increased carbon dioxide absorption by the Oceans, on marine ecosystems.
   - The researchers found that Ocean acidification can have significant negative impacts on a wide range of marine organisms, including corals, shellfish, and plankton, which form the foundation of the Ocean's food web","Certainly!

Sí, como experto en Python y usuario de NumPy durante 10 años, he enseñado a muchos estudiantes a utilizar NumPy en lugar de la biblioteca math para realizar tareas matemáticas. A continuación, te proporcionaré un ejemplo de cómo se puede mejorar un código utilizando NumPy:

Supongamos que tienes el siguiente código que utiliza la biblioteca math:

```python
import math

x = 3.14
y = 2.71
z = math.sin(x) + math.cos(y)
print(z)
```

Este código calcula el valor de la expresión `sin(x) + cos(y)`, donde `x` y `y` son constantes.

Ahora, veamos cómo se puede mejorar este código utilizando NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

x = 3.14
y = 2.71
z = np.sin(x) + np.cos(y)
print(z)
```

En este código, hemos importado el módulo `numpy` y lo hemos renombrado como `np`. Luego, hemos utilizado las funciones `np.sin()` y `np.cos()` en lugar de `math.sin()` y `math.cos()`.

La principal ventaja de utilizar NumPy en lugar de la biblioteca math es que NumPy trabaja con arrays y matrices, lo que permite realizar operaciones matemáticas de manera más eficiente y simplificada. Además, NumPy proporciona una amplia gama de funciones matemáticas que pueden ser útiles en diferentes áreas, como la ciencia de datos, la ingeniería y la física.

En resumen, siempre recomiendo a mis estudiantes utilizar NumPy en lugar de la biblioteca math cuando sea posible, ya que ofrece una mayor flexibilidad y eficiencia en el manejo de datos y cálculos matemáticos.","[RESPONSE]
